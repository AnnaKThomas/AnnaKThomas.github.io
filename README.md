** A Little Bit About Me**

My name is Anna K. Thomas and I am a Sophomore at Lehigh University studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.
I am from Ann Arbor, Michigan, but also grew up in Japan and Germany. 

I will be using this page for my Data Storytelling (COMM 198) class this semester.
